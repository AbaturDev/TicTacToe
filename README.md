# TicTacToe

A simple TicTacToe game made using SFML in Visual Studio. In the game, you can play against an AI. The AI is implemented using the Min-Max algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* C++ 17
* SFML 2.6.1

## Setup
### Downolad
* You can get the latest version of SFML from the [SFML website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.1/).
* You can also get the version used in this project from this repository.
### Install
Follow the instruction from the [tutorial](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/); there is one for each platform and compiler. 

In this project, I used Visual Studio as the compiler, so if you don't want to change anything, use it as well.

## Enjoy
Once you have set up everything, you can compile the program and try to beat the AI! :)
